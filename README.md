# Shrug

A short, simple bash script that copies the ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ emoticon to the system clipboard.

### Setup

Copy the ```shrug``` file to either your ```/bin/``` directory, or your ```~/bin/``` directory, if you have one set up.

### Usage

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| None | Copies the standard shrug emoticon to the clipboard                                |
| -r   | Copies a shrug emote that is properly formatted for a Reddit post to the clipboard |
